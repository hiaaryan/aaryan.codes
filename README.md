# Hello! I am Aaryan.

[![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde)

This is my personal website built on nextjs & tailwind. If you want to use it as your own, you just need to edit the "**index.tsx**" file in "**/pages**" folder.

## Installation

This application requires just nextjs for a build as minimum.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd website
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

For production environments.

```sh
$ yarn build
```

That's all, since it's a static website, I don't use any kind of database connection for storing user data. Feel free to contact me, if you have any issues with the installation.
