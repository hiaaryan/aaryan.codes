# Hello! I am Aaryan.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/myselfaaryan/aaryan.codes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/myselfaaryan/aaryan.codes) [![Version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/tterb%2FHyde)

This is my personal website built on gatsby & tailwind. If you want to use it as your own, you just need to edit the "**index.js**" file in "**src/pages**" folder.

## Installation

This application requires just gatsby for a build as minimum. Obviously, you should have gatsby-cli installed via yarn or npm.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd aaryan.codes
$ yarn install
$ gatsby develop
```

For production environments.

```sh
$ yarn build
```

That's all, since it's a static website, I don't use any kind of database connection for storing user data. Feel free to contact me, if you have any issues with the installation.
